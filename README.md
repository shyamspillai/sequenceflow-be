# Async Workflow Engine

This backend supports both synchronous and asynchronous workflow execution using BullMQ and Redis for massive horizontal scalability. The entire system runs via Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development (with Hot Reload)
```bash
# Start everything (API + Workers + Infrastructure + Monitoring)
npm run docker:dev

# Or manually:
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

### Production
```bash
# Start with 2 workers (default)
npm run docker:prod

# Or with custom worker count:
./scripts/prod-setup.sh 5 10  # 5 workers, 10 concurrency each
```

### Scaling Workers
```bash
# Scale to 10 workers
npm run docker:scale 10

# Or manually:
./scripts/scale-workers.sh 10
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### üîÑ Async Workflow System

The system has been refactored to support event-driven, asynchronous workflow execution:

1. **Task-Based Execution**: Each workflow node becomes an independent task
2. **Dependency Management**: Tasks are queued only when their dependencies are satisfied
3. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple worker processes can process tasks in parallel
4. **Event-Driven**: Node completion triggers downstream node evaluation
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling

### üèóÔ∏è Key Components

#### 1. **WorkflowTask Entity** (`entities/task.entity.ts`)
- Tracks individual node execution state
- Stores input/output payloads and dependencies
- Links to BullMQ job IDs for tracking

#### 2. **Queue System** (`queues/workflow.queue.ts`)
- `workflow-tasks`: Executes individual workflow nodes
- `workflow-dependencies`: Checks and triggers dependent tasks

#### 3. **Services**
- **AsyncWorkflowService**: Orchestrates async workflow execution
- **TaskExecutionService**: Executes individual tasks
- **DependencyService**: Manages task dependencies and triggers

#### 4. **Workers** (`worker.ts`)
- Standalone worker processes for horizontal scaling
- Configurable concurrency levels
- Graceful shutdown handling

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Service Architecture
```yaml
services:
  api:          # NestJS API Server
  worker:       # BullMQ Workers (scalable)
  postgres:     # Database
  redis:        # Queue & Cache
  redis-commander: # Redis GUI (optional)
  bullmq-board:    # Queue monitoring (optional)
```

```

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

### Built-in Dashboards
- **BullMQ Board**: http://localhost:3001 - Queue monitoring
- **Redis Commander**: http://localhost:8081 - Redis data browser

### Metrics to Monitor
- Queue length and processing rate
- Task execution times
- Failed job counts
- Worker memory/CPU usage
- Database connection pool usage

### Health Checks
All services include health checks:
- API server responds to HTTP requests
- Workers process heartbeat jobs
- Database connectivity
- Redis connectivity

## üîç Benefits of Docker Architecture

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Workers**: `docker-compose up --scale worker=10`
- **Zero Downtime**: Rolling updates and scaling
- **Resource Isolation**: Each service in its own container

### Reliability
- **Service Isolation**: Failed worker doesn't affect API
- **Auto Restart**: `restart: unless-stopped` policy
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks

### Performance
- **Optimized Images**: Multi-stage builds for production
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable CPU/memory limits
- **Efficient Networking**: Internal Docker networking

### Development Experience
- **Hot Reload**: Development changes restart services automatically
- **Consistent Environment**: Same stack across team members
- **Easy Setup**: Single command to start everything

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services not starting
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check service logs
npm run docker:logs:dev

# Reset environment
npm run docker:down:dev
npm run docker:dev
```

#### Worker scaling issues
```bash
# Check current workers
npm run docker:ps

# Force restart workers
docker-compose restart worker
```

#### Database connection issues
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL health
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v  # WARNING: Deletes data
npm run docker:dev
```

### Performance Tuning

#### High Load Scenarios
```bash
# Scale workers aggressively
./scripts/scale-workers.sh 20

# Increase worker concurrency
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=15 ./scripts/prod-setup.sh 10
```

#### Memory Optimization
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Limit worker memory
# Edit docker-compose.yml to add memory limits
```

This Docker-based architecture provides a production-ready, scalable workflow engine that can handle massive concurrent loads while being easy to develop, deploy, and maintain!
